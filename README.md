# computational_CI_test
A computational method for testing conditional independence
Scripts used for the article "Computational test for conditional independence with categorical variables"

multivariate_distributions: Functions to create data used in the simulations study
compCI_testing_functions: Functions used to create the null distribution and test statistic
example: illustrative example described in the article
simulations scripts: These scripts use parallel computing (multiple cores) to assess type I and type II error for computational testing. The output from these scripts where used to create the heatmaps and qqplots in the article.
